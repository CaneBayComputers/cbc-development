# ðŸš€ CBC Development Environment: Automated Project Setup

Welcome to the CBC Development Environment repository! This collection of scripts provides an automated way to set up and manage projectsâ€”whether Laravel, WordPress, or other PHP-based projectsâ€”on Ubuntu-based systems. The scripts handle everything from installation to project initialization and service management, ensuring a smooth development experience for users with basic Linux terminal knowledge.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Install Git
Ensure Git is installed before cloning the repository:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

### 2. Clone This Repository
Clone this repository to your local development environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CaneBayComputers/cbc-development.git
cd cbc-development
```

### 3. Run the Installer
Navigate to the `scripts` directory:
```bash
cd scripts
```

Run the `install.sh` script to install essential development tools and set up your environment:
```bash
./install.sh
```

This script handles the installation of Docker and other necessary dependencies.

## Script Overview and Usage

**Note**: Always navigate to the `scripts` directory before running any of the scripts.

### Creating a New Project
Use the `new_project.sh` script to create a new project:
```bash
./new_project.sh <project_name> [organization]
```
- **`<project_name>`**: The name of your new project (required).
- **`[organization]`**: (Optional) Specifies a GitHub organization.

### Cloning an Existing Project
Clone and set up an existing project:
```bash
./clone_project.sh <repository> [project_name]
```
- **`<repository>`**: The URL of the repository to clone (required).
- **`[project_name]`**: (Optional) Specifies a custom name for the cloned project.

### Setting Up a Project
Set up an already downloaded project:
```bash
./setup_project.sh <project_name>
```
- **`<project_name>`**: The name of the project (required). This script configures the environment files, Docker services, and runs migrations if applicable.

### Removing a Project
Delete a project and associated entries:
```bash
./remove_project.sh <project_name>
```
- **`<project_name>`**: The name of the project (required). This script removes the project directory, any related `iptables` rules, the Docker container, and the `/etc/hosts` entry associated with the project. Optionally, it can also delete the projectâ€™s database if confirmed by the user.

## Managing Services

### Starting Projects with `startup.sh`
The `startup.sh` script starts projects that have been stopped or after a system reboot, ensuring the necessary Docker containers are running and accessible.

#### How to Use `startup.sh`
- **Start All Projects**:
  ```bash
  ./startup.sh
  ```
  This will start all projects in the `projects` folder and make them accessible in the browser.

- **Start a Specific Project**:
  ```bash
  ./startup.sh <project_name>
  ```

#### Automation on System Startup
To automatically start all projects when your system is powered on, add the `startup.sh` script to your startup applications:
```bash
gnome-terminal -- bash -c "<path to cbc-development>/startup.sh; exec bash"
```

### Stopping Projects with `shutdown.sh`
The `shutdown.sh` script stops running Docker containers and removes custom `iptables` rules for your projects.

#### How to Use `shutdown.sh`
- **Shut Down All Projects**:
  ```bash
  ./shutdown.sh
  ```
  Stops all Docker containers associated with projects in the `projects` folder and removes custom `iptables` rules.

- **Shut Down a Specific Project**:
  ```bash
  ./shutdown.sh <project_name>
  ```

## Accessing and Checking Project Status

To view project access information, use the `status.sh` script. This script checks if your projects are running and provides URLs for browser access.

### How to Use `status.sh`
- **Run Without Parameters**:
  ```bash
  ./status.sh
  ```
  Displays the status of all projects in the `projects` folder.

  **Example Output**:
  ```text
  PROJECT: ticket-tracker-pro
  PROJECT FOLDER: FOUND
  HOST ENTRY: FOUND
  DOCKER STATUS: RUNNING
  IPTABLES RULES: ESTABLISHED

  LOCAL ACCESS: http://ticket-tracker-pro
  LAN ACCESS: http://192.168.1.5:135
  WAN ACCESS: http://<hidden>:135
  ```

- **Run with a Project Name**:
  ```bash
  ./status.sh <project_name>
  ```
  Displays the status for the specified project. If issues are detected, the script provides suggestions for resolving them.

### Access Details Explained:
- **Local Access**: URL for accessing the project from the same computer or within the virtual machine (e.g., `http://<project_name>`).
- **LAN Access**: URL for accessing the project from other computers on the same network (e.g., `http://<LAN_IP>:<port>`).
- **WAN Access**: URL for accessing the project from outside the local network (e.g., `http://<WAN_IP>:<port>`), provided the specified port is forwarded to the LAN IP of the machine.

Use `status.sh` to ensure your projects are accessible and running as expected.

## Accessing phpMyAdmin
To manage your database, navigate to:
```
http://cbc-phpmyadmin
```
This interface helps you manage your databases easily.

## Important Notes on Project Management

### Setup Considerations

- **Project Directory Location**: All projects are saved to the `projects` folder within the `cbc-development` directory. Projects **cannot be renamed or moved** after installation, as this will break configurations and services.
- **Automated Configuration**: The `new_project.sh` script is currently designed only for Laravel projects, while `clone_project.sh` supports any PHP project. Both scripts automatically set up the database name, derived from the project name, and add an entry to the `/etc/hosts` file. These configurations are managed by the setup process and should **not be changed manually** to avoid breaking dependencies and expected configurations.

### Using Existing Docker-Compose Files
- **For Projects with Existing `docker-compose.yml`**: If a Laravel or PHP project already includes its own `docker-compose.yml` file, itâ€™s recommended to follow that projectâ€™s original setup and installation instructions rather than using these scripts. Existing Docker configurations may have custom settings, dependencies, or services that differ from the setup provided by `cbc-development`. Using the projectâ€™s own setup will help ensure it functions as expected.

### Multiple Installations and VPC Configuration
- **Unique Networks**: Multiple `cbc-development` setups can run on the same machine, each using a unique `/24` VPC subnet.
- **Custom VPC Subnet**: To set a unique `10.x.x.x` network:
  1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the `docker-stack` folder.
  2. Set the `VPC_SUBNET` (e.g., `10.217.153`) without the D class.

**Example of `.env` Configuration**:
```bash
VPC_SUBNET=10.217.153
STACK_ID=EjpyugOY
```

## Sending Emails
Configure Exim for sending emails using Amazon SES or Gmail as an SMTP relay. The configuration should be done in the `.env` file.

### Amazon SES Configuration
1. **Set Up Amazon SES**: [Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/getting-started/)
2. **Generate SMTP Credentials**: [Instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/smtp-credentials.html)
3. **Add to `.env`**:
   ```bash
   # Amazon SES Configuration
   EXIM_SMARTHOST="email-smtp.<region>.amazonaws.com:587"
   EXIM_PASSWORD="*.amazonaws.com:<SMTP_USERNAME>:<SMTP_PASSWORD>"
   ```

### Gmail Configuration
1. **App Passwords Required**: Enable 2-Step Verification and create an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).
2. **Add to `.env`**:
   ```bash
   # Gmail Configuration
   EXIM_SMARTHOST="smtp.gmail.com:587"
   EXIM_PASSWORD="*.google.com:yourAccount@gmail.com:<APP_PASSWORD>"
   ```

**Note**: Using Gmail for SMTP relay now requires OAuth 2.0 for third-party applications.

## Helper Commands

During the installation process, the `install.sh` script adds a set of helper commands to your `.bash_aliases` file in your home directory. These commands are known as **aliases**, which are shortcuts to longer commands that simplify everyday tasks. Below are some of the most useful aliases included and how they can be used:

### Key Aliases and Their Uses

1. **Project-Specific Commands**:
   - **`art-docker`**: Runs Laravel Artisan commands inside the Docker container. Before using this command, navigate to the project directory you want to work on.
     ```bash
     cd ~/projects/my-laravel-project
     art-docker migrate
     ```
   - **`composer-docker`**: Runs Composer commands inside the Docker container, allowing you to manage PHP dependencies for your project.
     ```bash
     cd ~/projects/my-laravel-project
     composer-docker install
     ```

2. **Git Workflow Shortcuts**:
   - **`gquick`**: Stages all new and modified files, commits them with a user-provided message, and pushes to the current branch. This is perfect for quick fixes and updates.
     ```bash
     cd ~/projects/my-project
     gquick
     # Follow the prompt to input your commit message
     ```

3. **System and Command Enhancements**:
   - **`sudo` Aliases**: Many commands like `apt-get`, `ifconfig`, `iptables`, and `mount` are aliased to automatically include `sudo`, saving you from manually typing it each time.
     ```bash
     apt-get update    # Runs as `sudo apt-get update`
     iptables -L       # Runs as `sudo iptables -L`
     ```

4. **Terminal Customization**:
   - Change the color of your terminal text for better readability or emphasis using these aliases:
     ```bash
     echo-red "This is a warning message"
     echo-green "Operation successful"
     echo-blue "Informational message"
     ```

5. **Mounting S3 Buckets**:
   - **`mount-bucket`**: Quickly mounts an Amazon S3 bucket to your local filesystem. It prompts for the bucket name and creates a directory under `~/s3/` to mount it.
     ```bash
     mount-bucket
     # Enter the bucket name when prompted
     ```

6. **WAN IP Display**:
   - **`whatismyip`**: Displays your current WAN (external) IP address. This is useful for verifying external access and is also used in the `status.sh` script for WAN access checks.
     ```bash
     whatismyip
     ```

7. **Viewing or Modifying Aliases**:
   - **`bash_aliases`**: Will open your `~/.bash_aliases` file in an editor and reload any chages upon exiting.
     ```bash
     bash_aliases
     ```

These aliases are designed to make your workflow smoother and faster, allowing you to focus more on your projects and less on repetitive terminal commands.
