### Viewing and Accessing the MySQL Database

This project uses [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) to manage the database server however feel free to install a different client of choice.

If you are running a virtual machine you will have to install a different client within the virtual machine and not on the host machine.

To access phpMyAdmin simply open the browser and go to `http://cbc-phpmyadmin`.

If you are running a virtual machine there is a bookmark already saved in the pre-installed browser.
